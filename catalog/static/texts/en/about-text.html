<h3>Map Series</h3>
<p>
Map series can be described as results of extensive mapping, usually initiated by the 
military or other state institutions. Their characteristic features include the representation 
of large territories on several scales in the form of a series of separate map sheets with a 
common layout. Costly cartographic works have usually been continuously updated for many decades, 
with sheets showing regions of high interest having up tens of editions over the time. On the basis 
of national map series, further thematic maps were created. In some cases thematic content was 
added in the form of overprints of the original sheets.

The most important map series depicting the Czech territory is the Austrian and later 
Czechoslovak military mapping and Czechoslovak national map series originating in the 
second half of the 19th century. Important maps of the neighboring countries, especially 
the German map series from the time of the Second World War, are also worth mention.
