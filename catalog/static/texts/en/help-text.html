<h3>Help for Aleph library system</h3>
<p>
To make the cataloging module work properly, please first install and activate the 
<a href="https://github.com/moravianlibrary/AlephClipboard">AlephClipboard</a>
desktop application, which allows you to copy the template records to the Aleph cataloging module. 
Selection of the correct map serie and map sheet will give you a pre-filled MARC21 
format template. The template values that are repeated on several places in the record are added after editing the 
first occurrence of a given entry. After all edits are made, the resulting record needs to be transferred to Windows 
clipboard by pressing the Copy to clipboard button and then in Aleph 
cataloging module by using the ALT + D shortcut with AlephClipboard 
enabled. Please contact us with any suggestions on how to improve the application at <a href="mailto:mapy@mzk.cz">mapy@mzk.cz</a>.

<p>
  If you want to add a new map serie or a even a glid layout please let us know <a href="mailto:mapy@mzk.cz">mapy@mzk.cz</a> 
  and we will walk you through the workflow. It may seem complicated at first, but you will soon get the hang of it. 
  Your edits will be subjected to approval by the MZK supervisor.
